A diverse collection of study strategies is valuable because different subjects require different approaches to learning: One course might lend itself to writing summaries of key points from a lesson in your own words, while in another it may be more useful to create concept maps to organize information. The SRL assessment results suggest that you <strong>occasionally<\/strong> use different types of strategies to help you learn and remember information (see your responses below). You might not consistently use the most effective strategies, or perhaps, like many people, you have a limited repertoire. <\/p>\n\n<p>This scenario illustrates how using different strategies can help you more easily understand and remember information:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Steven, a second year college student, was feeling overwhelmed and defeated while studying for his math test. Steven&#39;s primary approach to studying was reading over the chapters and briefly reviewing his class notes. On many occasions, he became confused and did not understand what he was reading. Instead of going back and trying to understand the section, or using a different source to learn the information, he simply avoided what he did not understand. He thought to himself, &ldquo;I don&#39;t get this stuff, but I don&#39;t know what else I can do!&rdquo; When he talked to one of his classmates, Elizabeth, about his struggles, she opened up his eyes to a whole new way of studying. Elizabeth told him, &ldquo;When it comes to math, I need to do a lot of practice problems and see where I have trouble. Reading my notes is only helpful when I&#39;m trying to figure out a problem I don&#39;t understand. Taking the practice tests tells me which problems I have to study and which ones I have mastered.&rdquo; Steven asked Elizabeth where she learned this strategy. She told him that her high school teacher told her to do practice problems but she never understood their value until she read the SRL feedback.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Like many students, Steven studied for tests in a fairly narrow way. He tended to use the same study approach regardless of the class. His approach was often ineffective, but he didn&#39;t know what else to do. <\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Everyone<\/strong> can benefit from learning new ways to learn&ndash;it just comes down to finding out what they are and how to use them.

However, you might not consistently use effective strategies, or perhaps, like many students, you have a limited repertoire. <\/p>\n\n<p>This scenario illustrates how using different strategies can help you more easily understand and remember information:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Steven, a second year college student, was feeling overwhelmed and defeated while studying for his math test. Steven&#39;s primary approach to studying was reading over the chapters and briefly reviewing his class notes. On many occasions, he became confused and did not understand what he was reading. Instead of going back and trying to understand the section, or using a different source to learn the information, he simply avoided what he did not understand. He thought to himself, &ldquo;I don&#39;t get this stuff, but I don&#39;t know what else I can do!&rdquo; When he talked to one of his classmates, Elizabeth, about his struggles, she opened up his eyes to a whole new way of studying. Elizabeth told him, &ldquo;When it comes to math, I need to do a lot of practice problems and see where I have trouble. Reading my notes is only helpful when I&#39;m trying to figure out a problem I don&#39;t understand. Taking the practice tests tells me which problems I have to study and which ones I have mastered.&rdquo; Steven asked Elizabeth where she learned this strategy. She told him that her high school teacher told her to do practice problems but she never understood their value until she read the SRL feedback.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Like many students, Steven studied for tests in a fairly narrow way. He tended to use the same study approach regardless of the class. His approach was often ineffective, but he didn&#39;t know what else to do. <\/p>\n\n<p>All students can benefit from learning new ways to learn.

This semester, Sam was required to enroll in a college math course that covered material that was new to him. With the first exam of the semester approaching in one week, Sam reminded himself that he needed to study this new material. He sat down to study, but soon received a text from his friends inviting him to play basketball. Since the exam was a week away, Sam figured that he could play basketball that night and could study later; after all, it was important to stay in touch with friends and get exercise, too. As the week progressed, Sam got involved with assignments for other classes and more basketball games, and neglected to study for the math exam until two nights before the test. He decided to study each chapter that would be tested, and began to read the first one. The night before the test, Sam realized he had  finished only one of the four chapters, and the only way he could cover all the material was if he stayed up all night. Sam barely slept. By morning he felt anxious,  stressed, and still unprepared for the exam. He was so tired during the test that he could hardly think. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Sam realized he should have spaced out his studying over the course of the week, and set specific days and times to devote to his studies. He also knew he should have used the calendar on his phone to set up daily reminders about when and what to study.   <\/p>\n\n<p>We think that you would greatly benefit from learning more about time management.

You might do things like set aside regular times for schoolwork, use a calendar to mark down due dates for assignments, or keep track of how much time assignments take&ndash;but not as often as you could.  <\/p>\n\n<p>This scenario illustrates how insufficient time management tactics can adversely impact students in college:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sam, a second year college student, performs well in some classes but not in others. He tends to struggle most in classes that involve very unfamiliar information or when there are a lot of different assignments to complete. This semester, Sam was required to enroll in a college math course that covered material that was new to him. With the first exam of the semester approaching in one week, Sam reminded himself that he needed to study this new material. He sat down to study, but soon received a text from his friends inviting him to play basketball. Since the exam was a week away, Sam figured that he could play basketball that night and could study later; after all, it was important to stay in touch with friends and get exercise, too. As the week progressed, Sam got involved with assignments for other classes and more basketball games, and neglected to study for the math exam until two nights before the test. He decided to study each chapter that would be tested, and began to read the first one. The night before the test, Sam realized he had  finished only one of the four chapters, and the only way he could cover all the material was if he stayed up all night. Sam barely slept. By morning he felt anxious,  stressed, and still unprepared for the exam. He was so tired during the test that he could hardly think. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Sam realized he should have spaced out his studying over the course of the week, and set specific days and times to devote to his studies. He also knew he should have used the calendar on his phone to set up daily reminders about when and what to study.   <\/p>\n\n<p>We think that you would benefit from learning more about time management.
