Your score suggests that the ideas or information in each sentence within the paragraphs in your essay are generally but not consistently linked together. Additional or better choices of linking words and phrases would clarify the connections between ideas within paragraphs. As you write, you might check to see if you are using linking words and phrases such as adverbs (e.g., similarly, also, therefore), relative pronouns (e.g., who, that, which), conjunctions (e.g., and, or, while, whereas). Also aim for strategic repetition of key words. You can learn more about linking words here: https://owl.excelsior.edu/writing-process/paragraphing/paragraphing-and-transitioning/
