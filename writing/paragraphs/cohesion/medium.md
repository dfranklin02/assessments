## Paragraphs: Cohesion

Writing has cohesion when the statements, ideas, and information in a paragraph are explicitly linked together. Cohesion is partly a function of the use of transitions, which indicate to a reader how statements are connected. Writers also achieve cohesion by repeating key words or phrases (Yagelski, 2015). Writers sometimes mistakenly believe that repeating words and phrases is a mark of poor writing, but strategic repetition makes a passage more cohesive and therefore strengthens the writing. Notice, for example, how the repetition of the word cohesion in this paragraph lets you know that the focus on cohesion is maintained throughout. If we had worried about repetition and replaced cohesion with the vague pronoun it, the paragraph would lack cohesion as well as clarity.
