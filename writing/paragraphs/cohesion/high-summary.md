Your score suggests that the individual sentences within the paragraphs in your essay are seamlessly linked together; a reader can see the relationship between the ideas or information in one sentence and those in another sentence. You might have explicitly linked sentences and ideas using adverbs (e.g., similarly, also, therefore), relative pronouns (e.g., who, that, which), conjunctions (e.g., and, or, while, whereas), and/or the repetition of key words.
