## Conventions

Correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization lend clarity and credibility to academic writing, which should require little or no editing.
While conventions and their usage in writing may seem trivial and easy, people are sometimes denied access to colleges and jobs because they overlooked errors in their cover letters and applications. Papers written for college should also be virtually error free. Therefore, editing should be second nature. Rereading your writing with an eye for proper spelling, punctuation, and capitalization will let you see where a period or comma is needed, and where you have left out a word or two.
