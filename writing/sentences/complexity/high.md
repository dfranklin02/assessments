## Sentences: Complexity

Sentences vary in their level of complexity, such that all sentences contain an independent clause (and sometimes more than one), and some sentences also contain a dependent clause.  An independent clause is a group of words that stand on their own (e.g., “I scored high on learning strategies”), while a dependent clause only makes sense with the independent clause (e.g., “I scored high on learning strategies, which I believe is due to my ability to effectively manage my time and environment. ).  Effective writers often use a variety of sentence structures, depending on the ideas they intend to convey.
Writing a good complex or compound sentence is challenging. You might want to use multiple dependent and independent clauses in a sentence to make an important point, but you could end up with a long sentence that has little meaning. One way to avoid this problem is to have a very good understanding of the meanings of and differences between dependent and independent clauses, as well as how to combine them in a way that makes sense.
