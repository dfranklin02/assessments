Your score suggests that some of the sentences in your essay include errors such as run-ons, fragments, or problems with subject-verb agreement. Since errors like these make it hard to communicate clearly, we recommend following these links to resources on sentence structure:

In addition, try reading your writing aloud: This will help you to identify sentences and phrases that do not sound right. You can also ask a friend, significant other, or a family member to read your writing. Other people are often helpful in catching small errors that writers overlook. You might also want to talk to someone in your collegeâ€™s writing center about how to write sentences.
