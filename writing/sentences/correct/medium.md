## Sentences: Correctness

Sentences are grammatically correct when they contain a clear subject and a predicate that states something about that subject, as well as other appropriate words to convey meaning. Grammatically incorrect sentences are run-ons (i.e., too many ideas without proper links between them), fragments (i.e., no groupings of words that make sense on their own), and/or have errors in subject-verb agreement (e.g., “the sentences is grammatically correct” instead of “the sentences are grammatically correct”).
