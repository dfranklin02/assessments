## Content: Summary

A summary typically contains the main ideas or information from a source in the writerâ€™s own words (Yagelski, 2015). In the case of the DAACS writing assessment, a good summary uses relevant survey results and feedback to provide a detailed summary of both your strengths and weaknesses in terms of SRL, in order to lay a foundation for the suggestions. 
A summary should not be confused with a paraphrase. The main difference between a summary and a paraphrase is that a summary boils a source down into a brief passage, whereas a paraphrase restates the source text. Typically, a summary conveys only the main ideas and is shorter than a paraphrase.
