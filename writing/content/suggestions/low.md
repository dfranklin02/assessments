## Content: Suggestions

In the context of the DAACS writing assessment, suggestions refer to the steps you wrote about taking to improve your SRL. The suggestions to which you commit should be logically and explicitly related to the survey results and feedback, and developed in sufficient depth. The feedback you received after taking the SRL survey provides suggestions you can write about. The SRL Lab (LINK) has more great ideas for addressing learning challenges. In addition, you might contact your coach or advisor about strategies that will benefit you the most.
