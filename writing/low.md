The writing assessment serves three important purposes. It provides an opportunity to reflect on your self-regulated learning survey results, gives you feedback about your writing and suggestions for improving it, as needed; and directs you to online resources that can help you strengthen your writing skills. Your results are below. Click through each section for information about the rubric used to score your writing, as well as suggestions for improvement and links to useful resources. 

Although we have taken steps to ensure that the scoring of DAACS essays is accurate, some essays are harder to evaluate than others. If you question the accuracy of your results, feel free to reach out to your student mentor, advisor, or the writing center to discuss your writing.
