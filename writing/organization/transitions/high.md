## Organization: Transitions

A transition is a word or phrase that gets your reader from one paragraph or section of your essay to the next, such as “Another strength in my SRL is…” or “The second way I will improve is…”. Transitions help your readers follow along by making the logic and organization of your essay clear. 
Sometimes the connection between one paragraph and another is simply revealed by the subject matter or repeated words. Explicit transitions are necessary when there is a shift in the focus or topic from one paragraph to the next, and when moving from one main section of a document to another.
